% n: inward-pointing direction of a contact normal [nx; ny; nz]; 3x1 vector
% R: a rotation matrix with positive x-axis aligned with n; 3x3 matrix
%
% NOTE: As only one direction vector is specified, there is one redundant degree of freedom in the determination of R

function [R] = computeRotMat(n)

% write your code here
x = [1, 0, 0]';

n = n / norm(n);
r = vrrotvec(x,n);
R = vrrotvec2mat(r);
